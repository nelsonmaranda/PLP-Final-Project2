# Week 4: Core Features Implementation

## Overview
Week 4 focused on implementing core functionality including rate limiting, device fingerprinting, scoring service, and API endpoints for route scoring and analytics.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Rate Limiting & Device Fingerprinting
- **Backend**: Implemented rate limiting middleware using `express-rate-limit`
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Added device identification for report submissions
- **Security**: Enhanced API protection against abuse and spam

### 2. Scoring Service Implementation
- **Cron Job**: Set up `node-cron` for periodic score recalculation
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Implemented comprehensive scoring system based on:
  - Reliability metrics (on-time performance)
  - Safety reports and incidents
  - Punctuality data
  - Comfort ratings
  - Overall route quality assessment

### 3. API Endpoints
- **`/api/scores`**: Expose route scores and analytics
- **Score Calculation**: Automated background processing
- **Real-time Updates**: Scores update based on new reports

### 4. Frontend Integration
- **Map View**: Display route scores on the interactive map
- **Score Visualization**: Color-coded route quality indicators
- **Filtering**: Filter routes by reliability and safety scores
- **Real-time Data**: Fetch and display current route scores

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
```javascript
// Rate limiting middleware
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const reportLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5, // limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many reports from this IP, please try again later.'
});

// Scoring service with cron job
const cron = require('node-cron');

cron.schedule('0 */6 * * *', async () => {
  await calculateRouteScores();
});
```

### Frontend Changes
```typescript
// Score display component
interface RouteWithScores extends Route {
  score?: {
    reliability: number;
    safety: number;
    punctuality: number;
    comfort: number;
    overall: number;
  };
}

// Map integration with scores
const displayRouteScores = (routes: RouteWithScores[]) => {
  routes.forEach(route => {
    if (route.score) {
      const marker = L.marker(route.coordinates);
      marker.bindPopup(`
        <h3>${route.name}</h3>
        <p>Reliability: ${route.score.reliability}/10</p>
        <p>Safety: ${route.score.safety}/10</p>
        <p>Overall: ${route.score.overall}/10</p>
      `);
    }
  });
};
```

## Key Features Delivered

### 1. Route Scoring System
- **Multi-dimensional Scoring**: Reliability, safety, punctuality, comfort
- **Weighted Algorithm**: Different factors weighted based on importance
- **Historical Data**: Scores based on accumulated report data
- **Regular Updates**: Automated recalculation every 6 hours

### 2. Enhanced Map Experience
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded routes based on quality scores
- **Interactive Popups**: Detailed score breakdown on route selection
- **Filtering Options**: Filter by high reliability, safe routes
- **Real-time Updates**: Live score updates as new data comes in

### 3. Security Enhancements
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse and spam
- **Device Tracking**: Unique device identification for reports
- **Input Validation**: Enhanced validation for all report submissions

## API Endpoints Added

### GET /api/scores
- **Purpose**: Retrieve route scores and analytics
- **Response**: Array of routes with calculated scores
- **Authentication**: Public endpoint

### POST /api/reports (Enhanced)
- **Purpose**: Submit new reports with rate limiting
- **Rate Limit**: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Automatic device identification

## Database Schema Updates

### Scores Collection
```javascript
{
  routeId: ObjectId,
  reliability: Number, // 0-10
  safety: Number,      // 0-10
  punctuality: Number, // 0-10
  comfort: Number,     // 0-10
  overall: Number,     // 0-10
  totalReports: Number,
  lastCalculated: Date,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- Rate limiting middleware
- Scoring algorithm functions
- Device fingerprinting logic
- API endpoint responses

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end report submission with rate limiting
- Score calculation and retrieval
- Map display with score data

## Performance Considerations

### Backend Optimization
- **Cron Job Efficiency**: Optimized score calculation to run every 6 hours
- **Database Indexing**: Added indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Caching**: Implemented basic caching for score data

### Frontend Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Map markers loaded on demand
- **Debounced Filtering**: Prevent excessive API calls during filtering
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized map updates and re-renders

## Security Measures

### Rate Limiting
- **IP-based Limiting**: 5 reports per 15 minutes per IP
- **Progressive Delays**: Increasing delays for repeated violations
- **Whitelist Support**: Admin IPs can bypass rate limits

### Device Fingerprinting
- **Unique Identification**: Generate unique device IDs
- **Privacy Compliant**: No personal data collection
- **Abuse Prevention**: Track and limit device-specific submissions

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Score Analytics
- **Trend Tracking**: Monitor score changes over time
- **Route Comparison**: Compare performance across routes
- **Quality Metrics**: Track overall system quality improvements

### Usage Monitoring
- **Rate Limit Hits**: Track when rate limits are triggered
- **Popular Routes**: Identify most frequently reported routes
- **System Health**: Monitor API performance and response times
